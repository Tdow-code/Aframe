A-Frame Builder v49.4 A web-based tool for planning and visualizing the loading of stone slabs onto A-frame trucks with intelligent distribution, drag-and-drop rearrangement, and comprehensive validation.

Overview This application helps logistics teams optimize truck loading by

Automatically distributing slabs across A-frame racks based on weight and constraints Providing visual drag-and-drop interface for manual adjustments Validating load safety (weight limits, balance, customer restrictions) Generating printable loading manifests with customer stop information Features Core Functionality CSV Import Process load reports with stop numbers, customer info, and slab details Intelligent Distribution Automatically assigns slabs to frames considering Weight limits (per side and total) Thickness constraints (CM limits) Customer restrictions (back-only requirements) Load balancing between driverpassenger sides Interactive Controls Drag & Drop Move slabs between frames and sides Manual Slab Addition Add custom slabs with stop insertionrenumbering Frame Management Remove empty frames from layout Layout Reset Restore original automated distribution Validation & Safety Real-time Alerts Notifications for overloads, imbalances, and placement violations Customer Restrictions Enforces backfront placement requirements Weight Calculations Automatic weight estimation based on slab size and thickness Output Visual Truck Layout Color-coded representation of loaded frames Printable Manifest Stop-by-stop customer summary with notes Side Statistics Weight totals for each frame side Quick Start Open the application Load Aframe Builder Default.html in a web browser Enter Truck Name Use DEFAULT for standard 4-frame configuration Upload CSV Click upload zone and select a properly formatted load report Review & Adjust Drag slabs between frames as needed Add manual slabs using the + Add Slab button Check for validation warnings (displayed in top-right) Print Use the print button for a formatted loading report CSV Format Requirements Your load report CSV must include these columns

Stop Number or Stop - Delivery sequence (higher numbers = first stops) Customer Name - Customer identification Item Description - Slab description (used for sizeweight calculation) Lot Number - Slab inventory identifier Locator - Warehouse location code Lot Status - Active or Inactive status Slab Description Parsing The system automatically detects

Sizes 60 (standard), 47 (standard), 30 (half) Thickness 3CM, 2CM, 1CM Design Extracted from description (removes sizethickness text) Example 3CM 60 Polished Slab Calacatta Gold → Design Calacatta Gold

Manual Slab Addition Use the Add Slab button to insert custom slabs

Stop Insertion Adding a slab to an existing stop number inserts a new stop and renumbers subsequent stops Customer Matching Slabs added to existing customer stops maintain stop numbering Automatic Placement System attempts to place manual slabs following the same distribution rules Truck Configurations Default Configuration (4 frames) F1 Back Right (Rear zone) F2 Back Left (Rear zone) F3 Front Right (Front zone) F4 Front Left (Front zone) Custom Configurations Modify the TRUCK_DB object in the code to add custom truck layouts with different frame arrangements and weight limits.

Safety Limits Max Weight per Side 3,600 lbs (default) Max Thickness per Side 14CM (default) Max Imbalance 1,500 lbs difference between sides Customer Restrictions Back-only customers cannot be placed on front frames Keyboard Shortcuts Print Browser print shortcut (Ctrl+P) or on-screen print button Reset Reset Layout button to restore automated distribution Drag & Drop Click and drag slabs between frames Browser Compatibility Chrome (recommended) Firefox Safari Edge Note Requires modern browser with ES6+ support and dragdrop API
